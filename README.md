# Keras-DigitRecognition

Images of digits were taken from a variety of scanned documents, normalized in size and centered. This makes it an excellent dataset for evaluating models, allowing the developer to focus on the machine learning with very little data cleaning or preparation required.

Each image is a 28 by 28 pixel square (784 pixels total). A standard spit of the dataset is used to evaluate and compare models, where 60,000 images are used to train a model and a separate set of 10,000 images are used to test it.

DataSet for Training and Testing is available online on various platforms.
